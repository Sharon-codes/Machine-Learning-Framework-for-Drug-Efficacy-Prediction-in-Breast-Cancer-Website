            <h2>What This Is About</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you're trying to find the best medicine to fight breast cancer. We looked at two big sets of information: one tells us how well drugs work on cancer cells (called GDSC2), and another tells us about breast cancer patients (called TCGA-BRCA). We made a smart tool (a model) that guesses how much medicine you need to stop the cancer cells. We also drew pictures (graphs) to make it easier to understand what we found.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="insights">
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Different Cancers Need Different Amounts of Medicine:</span> Some cancers, like pancreatic cancer (PAAD), need a lot of medicine to stop them (around 3.5 on our scale). Others, like brain cancer (GBM), need less (around 3.0). This means some cancers are tougher to treat.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">How Medicines Work for Breast Cancer:</span> For breast cancer, if a medicine needs a lot to work (a high number on our scale), it usually doesn't work as well overall. Itâ€™s like needing a big hammer to crack a small nutâ€”itâ€™s not the best tool!</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Cancer Stages Matter:</span> Early breast cancer (Stage I) needs less medicine than advanced cancer (Stage IV). Itâ€™s like cleaning a small mess versus a big oneâ€”you need more effort for the big mess.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">What Affects the Medicine Most:</span> Our smart tool says the medicineâ€™s overall strength (AUC) and how much of it we used in tests (MAX_CONC and MIN_CONC) are the biggest clues to guess how well it will work. Things like the patientâ€™s age matter less.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Cool Fact:</span> Patients with advanced breast cancer (Stage IV) who get a medicine called Paclitaxel act differently to it. This means doctors might need to change the medicine plan depending on how far the cancer has spread.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="graphs">
            <h2>Understanding the Graphs</h2>
            
            <h3>Graph 1: How Much Medicine Different Cancers Need</h3>
            <p>
                Think of this graph as a scoreboard for cancers. The names on the bottom (like PAAD, GBM) are different types of cancer. The numbers on the side (2.5 to 3.5) show how much medicine they need to stop growing. A bigger number means they need more medicine, so theyâ€™re harder to beat. For example, PAAD needs the most (3.5), while GBM needs less (3.0).
            </p>

                <div class="graph-caption">This graph shows which cancers are harder to treat with medicine.</div>
            </div>

            <h3>Graph 2: How Much Medicine vs. How Well It Works (For Breast Cancer)</h3>
            <p>
                This graph is like a map for breast cancer medicines. Each dot is a test we did with a medicine. The left-to-right line (x-axis) shows how much medicine we need (a bigger number means more medicine). The up-down line (y-axis) shows how well the medicine works (closer to 1 is better). Most dots show that if we need a lot of medicine (big number on the x-axis), the medicine doesnâ€™t work as well (low number on the y-axis). Itâ€™s like saying a big shovel doesnâ€™t always dig the best hole!

            </div>

            <h3>Graph 3: How Much Medicine Each Stage of Breast Cancer Needs</h3>
            <p>
                This graph is like a guide for breast cancer stages. The names on the bottom (Stage I, Stage IV, etc.) are how far the cancer has spread (Stage I is early, Stage IV is advanced). The numbers on the side show how much medicine each stage needs. For example, Stage IV needs more medicine (around 3.3) than Stage I (around 3.0). Itâ€™s like needing a bigger mop for a bigger spill!

                <div class="graph-caption">This graph shows how cancer stage changes the amount of medicine needed.</div>
            </div>

            <h3>Graph 4: What Helps Our Smart Tool Guess the Best Medicine</h3>
            <p>
                 This graph is like a recipe card for our smart tool, showing the key ingredients it uses to guess how much medicine is needed to fight breast cancer. The names on the side (like AUC, MAX_CONC, tumor stage) are the most important clues it looks at. The length of each bar shows how much each clue mattersâ€”longer bars mean bigger impact. For example, AUC (how well a medicine works overall) is a top clue because it shows how effective a drug like Paclitaxel is. Tumor stage (like Stage I or IV) also matters a lot, as advanced cancers need more medicine. Less important clues, like average patient age, are left out to keep things clear. Itâ€™s like focusing on the main spices in a dish to get the flavor just right!

            <h2>How We Can Use This</h2>
            <p>
                Our smart tool is like a helper for doctors. It guesses how much medicine is needed to fight breast cancer by looking at things like how strong the medicine is and how far the cancer has spread. Hereâ€™s how it can help:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Pick the Best Medicine:</span> Doctors can choose medicines that donâ€™t need a lot to work and are really good at stopping cancer.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Make a Plan for Each Patient:</span> If a patient has early cancer (Stage I), they might need less medicine than someone with advanced cancer (Stage IV).</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Help Scientists:</span> Researchers can use this to find out what makes a medicine work best, so they can make even better medicines in the future.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Example: Helping a Patient Named Sarah</h3>
                <p>
                    Letâ€™s say Sarah is a 45-year-old patient with Stage IV breast cancer. Her doctor wants to use a medicine called Paclitaxel. Our smart tool looks at Sarahâ€™s cancer stage and the medicineâ€™s details. It guesses that Sarah might need a bit more Paclitaxel (around 3.3 on our scale) because her cancer is advanced. It also checks how well Paclitaxel works (AUC) and says itâ€™s pretty good (around 0.8). The doctor can use this to decide the right amount of Paclitaxel for Sarah, making sure it works well without giving too much.

            <h2>Model Results</h2>
            <p>
                We tested our smart tool to see how good it is at guessing. Itâ€™s like giving it a test to see if it can get the answers right. Hereâ€™s what we found:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">How Close Are the Guesses?</span> We checked how close the toolâ€™s guesses are to the real answers (called RMSE). A smaller number means better guesses. Our tool scored 0.21, which means itâ€™s very accurateâ€”the lower the number, the better the guess !</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">How Much Does It Understand?</span> We checked how much of the puzzle the tool can solve (called RÂ², from 0 to 1). A bigger number means it understands more. Our tool got 0.89, meaning it understands 89% of what affects the medicineâ€™s success. Thatâ€™s like getting an A on a tough exam!</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Does It Work Every Time?</span> We tested it on different pieces of information to make sure itâ€™s reliable (called Cross-Validation RMSE). Our tool scored about 0.23, showing itâ€™s consistent even when we mix up the data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These tests tell us our smart tool is good at helping doctors and scientists with breast cancer medicines.
